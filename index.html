                            <p>Ever since the pandemic came, and the first lockdown is about to happen, a lot of changes in my physical, mental, and spiritual aspect
                                had changed. For example, my bodyclock. Before, I sleep between 11-1 after school since I do all my assessments and do games and during the 
                                start of the pandemic, I sleep even at 2-4 or 5am to either do my assessment or expose myself to computer games for rest and mind reset since 
                                academic and sometimes house stress happens everyday. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Because of it, I got a 4-7hr sleeping time compared to the 8-10 or 12hrs bodyclock I got before the
                                pandemic. Since we stay at home for online class, the consistency of doing household chores is 
                                one of the challenges here on how I must be able to balance between computer exposure and household chores. Another is my body. Since I eat at midnight, 
                                my body is expanding to the point my face and tummy is slowly becoming fat. This picture was taken during my birthday last 2020.

                            <p>Until now the pandemic came, mental and sometimes spiritual stress came into my life due to mishandling myself and time management. In my mental health, an 
                                inconsistency to my academic mentality came happened ever since an assessent really challenged me. Turns out I did it but due to 
                                the grades I got, I became depressed and my academic mind wherein I submit a day or two before the deadline, now I sometimes submit by beating the red light. And in my 
                                spritual being, it was a big challenge to me since there is a limitation in serving the church or chapel. Despite all those, I continue to make progress in balancing myself
                                between my habits of computer gaming, academic duties and household chores. Now, this picture was taken during the sample shots in the Gawad Awards of the CSCS since I am part 
                                of the Dean's Lister.

                                Another was the fact I consider a blessing wherein I was accepted, not just one but two of the dream orgs I got in life. The CSITPC and the VICISSITUDE. 
                                It is my dream to join a program council to amplify my social skills and become a stuent leader at the same time I want to learn what is in the yearbook and how the skeletal system or 
                                workforce there works. Once I knew them, I want to be part of it to know my fellow seniors and future graduates of my batch. Adding on is the CPM and I am an altar server there (see #2 SACRISTAN 
                                and RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES) to amplify my spiritual and of course, my social skills again. After the pandemic, I want to return my usual body in 2019 since I really am a payatot person that time.

                            among them, I like and lets say GAMAY KO NA CHAMPION. He is Volibear. He is a Bear God of Freljord and his reworked skills are really
                            good to the point I invest time to master his skills and reach him to mastery 7 last July 2020. And this champion is like me because

                        <p>GENSHIN IMPACT. I started playing this game post-November 2020. It was caused by an influence of a friend and I started playing it at my first PC. Since it was really 
                            incompatible, I played it at my PS4 console. Yet I learned that Mihoyo account and PS4 account cannot cross-save from any platform, it saddens me. Despite that I continue to play it to explore the rest of the game.
                            Fortunately, I created 4 accounts, 2 for PC and 2 for PS4. And finally I played Genshin on the PC when I had my first laptop last April 2021. My Favorite character is Razor but what I love the most is Noelle since she got a real
                            balance between defense and offense, causing me to addict to it and increase her talents up to level 10 and offer her 3 crowns. Noelle and Razor is just like me because I love to serve others at the same time, I am a kid at heart despite 
                            I am 21 years old.

                        <p>VALORANT. The latest game I entered upon a few weeks ago or lets say a month. Since I am a person who hates shooting, because of my friends who plays it and their influence, I finally started to play it in order to at least get out of my comfort
                            zone. This shooting game is the hardest because you have to use guns at the same time your skills, unlike LOL wherein you have to simply use your skills there. Among all of the agents there, I chose KAY/O and Kiljoy as my best and "gamay na agent"
                            Killjoy because she is a sentinel, holding and defending the base at the same time, she protects and cues everyone if there is an opponent who is attacking us AND KAY/O because he nullifies the opponent's skills. They are both like me because I love 
                            to be aggresive at the same time I love to defend and give info to my teammates and in life.

                    <p> I became a sacristan last 2012 because I saw one guy serving at the altar one time and I said to myself 
                        "ang astig naman nya, parang sundalong naglilingkod sa altar". That is why I entered altar serving. Up to 2015 
                    and a year of rest, I once again entered an altar serving organization at the DLSUMC in 2016. Up to present, I am 
                still serving there. My last serve at the chapel was last March 2021 and it got stop since there is an immersion of the second wave of the pandemic. Other religious things I do is that I joing religious orgs inside the university such as the 
                CPM or 
            Campus Peer Ministry in DLSU-D. Up to now, despite an inactive member, I do my best to attend their webinars during this pandemic.</p>

                <p> When I got no things to do and "nakatunganga lang ako" I am thinking to reflect something on. That is why I look to my cellphone 
                    or laptio to see my friend's pics with me. On the first pic is my Friends in my elementary days. At first, they bully me for some hilarious
                reasons then later on as we came to senior high school, we became brothers. Eat, drank alcohol, and in rare occassions, sleepover before the pandemic. 
            <br>
        <br>
    On the second picture are my first friends in High School, LEOVEN aka LEVI and SHAN. We knew each other last Grade 9 during our Technical Drafiting Class and in the end,
we passed the NCII Certificate when we became Grade 10 students. Despite during Senior High days wherein we gone to separate schools, now Levi is in PHILSCA and SHAN is in a marine
school in Davao City, we never forget to meet each other in our subdivision. We go play basketball, order foods and even go karaoke in Levi's place since it got an exclusve basketball
court. Despite we chat seldomly, our bond never breaks because we promise to each other to keep ourselves update even in the rarest moments of their time.
<br>
<br>
For the third and last pic I got was the picture of ME, AALIYAH LIVETA, JOHNDEL ENCABO and AUBREY GOMEZ. Soon we will have a "family picture" with MARIA CASSANDRA VITUG since she is at
the abroad at the moment. This is TAJACK, my first family in college. I met them when we became classmates for the first semester during this Freshman year 2020-2021 here at DLSU-D. It all started 
with me and cassadra, then when there is an assessment that is really hard almost our brains can't keep on, we asked for aaliyah and aubrey's help and lastly, when there is an assessent in math that is really hard
too, way too hard than our previous assessments, we asked for johndel's help. That way, TAJACK was born and out of the blue, we became friends for more than "na for assessments lang friendship namin" reason. That is 
why when we are in our hards times in life, or even need someone for karamay and the likes, kasangga namin ang isa't isa sa hirap at ginhawa. Even us we taught each other on how to stand alone too. And for that I wish 
that our friendship lasts, even after our college days or one fo of us will go to shift course one.
